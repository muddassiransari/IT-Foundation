DV129_16_PAS On Assigning IP Addresses
Possible-Assessment Sheet
1. How to assign IPv4 IP addresses for Private IP?
Ans: Private IP addresses are used within a local network and are not routable on the public internet. They are reserved for internal use to help devices communicate within a network without conflicting with public IP addresses. 
2. What is the process of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?
Ans: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol process involves the automated assignment of IP addresses and related network configuration settings to devices on a network. 
3. What is the result of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?
Ans: The result of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol process is the successful assignment of IP addresses and related network configuration setting to devices on a network. The DHCP process ensure that devices can seamlessly connect to a network without the need for manual IP configuration, which simplifies network management and allows for efficient use IP addresses. 
4. What Features of Static IP address?
5. Features of Dynamic IP address?
6. What is Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA)?
Ans: Automatic Private IP Addressing is a feature used in windows operating systems to automatically an IP address to a device when a DHCP server is not available or cannot provide a valid IP configuration. 
7. What is unicast address?
Ans: A unicast address is a type of network address used in communication where data packets are sent from a single sender to a specific recipient. in unicast communication, a data packet is addressed to a unique destination, allowing for one-to-one communication between a sender and a single receiver.
8. What is multicast addresses?
Ans: A multicast address is a type of network address used in communication where data packets are sent from a single sender to multiple recipients who are part of a specific group. 
9. What is anycast addresses?
Ans: An anycast address is a network addressing scheme used in communication where data packets are sent from a sender to the nearest of multiple recipients providing the same service.  
10. What is BootP?
Ans: BOOTP is a legacy network protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to network devices during their boot process.
