DV129_9_PAS On Introduction to IP
Self -Assessment Sheet


1. What is Internet Protocol (IP)?
Ans: Internet Protocol (IP) is a fundamental set of rules and procedures that governs the delivery of data packets ocer a network , particularly the internet. It serves as the backbone of the internet of the communication system. 
2. What is the meaning of Encapsulation?
Ans: Encapsulation, In the context of computer science and programming ,is a fundamental concept of object- oriented programming.
3. What does TCP stand for?
Ans: TCP stands for Transmission control protocol.
4. How does TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) work?
Ans: TCP works by providing reliable, ordered, and error-communication between two devices over a network, typically the internet.        
5. What does UDP stand for?
Ans: User Datagram protocol.        
6. How does UDP (User Datagram Protocol) work?
Ans: UDP is another transport protocol in the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP), but it operates quite differently from TCP. UDP prvivides a lightweight and connection communication mechanism, making it suitable for application where speed and low overhead are more important than guaranteed delivery and error checking. 
7. What is OSI Layer 4?
Ans:OSI Layer 4 refers to the fourth layer of the OSI model, which is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the function of networking and communication protocols.
8. What does OSI Layer 4 - Transport Layer do?
Ans: Layer 4 of the OSI model is known as the Transport layer. Its primary purpose is to manage end-to-end communication and data flow. 
9. What is Multiplexing?
Ans: Multiplexing is a technique used in telecommunication and computer networks to multiple data streams or signale transmission channel or medium. 
10. What is a port?
Ans: In the context of computer networking and communication protocols, a port refers to a logical endpoint for communication in a computer system. Ports are used to distinguish different services or across a network.  
11. What is a Port Number?
Ans: There are two port numbers used by FTP. One is TCP port 20. This is for data transfers. And TCP port 21, which is used to control the data transfer.
12. What does IPv4 Socket consist of?
Ans: An IPv4 socket consists of two main components: an IP address and a port number. Together, these components uniquely identify a communication endpoint in a computer network. 
13. What are Non-Ephemeral Ports?
Ans: Non-ephermeral ports, also known as well-known ports,are a subset of port numbers used in computer networking to designate specific services or application that are commonly recognized and standardized.
14. What are Ephemeral Ports?
Ans: Ephemeral ports, also known as dynamic ports or private ports, are temporary port numbers used in computer networking for client-server communication. 
15. What is Data Transport Analogy?
Ans: The data transport analogy is away of explaining complex concepts relatedto data communication,networking,and information exchange by drawing parallels to real-world scenarios or activities that people are more familiar with.
16. What is Network Topology?
Ans: Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices,nodes,andconnection within a computer network. It defines how devices are interconnected and how data flowa between them.
